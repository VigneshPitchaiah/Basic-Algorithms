# Problem 1: Perceptron
Assignment: Machine Learning
This assignment consists of three problems related to machine learning. Follow the instructions carefully for each problem.


In this problem, you are given a set of training samples and are asked to use the perceptron algorithm to find the decision boundary that separates the two classes.

Training Samples
The training samples are given in the following table:


**<div align="center"> Sampel Data </div>**



| x1  | x2   | Class |
| --- | ---- | ----- |
| 1   | 1    | +1    |
| -1  | -1   | -1    |
| 0   | 0.5  | -1    |
| 0.1 | 0.5  | -1    |
| 0.2 | 0.2  | +1    |
| 0.9 | 0.5  | +1    |


Tasks
Determine the number of steps that the perceptron learning algorithm will take to converge.
Find the final decision boundary and show the step-by-step update of the weight vector using computation as well as a hand-drawn plot.


# Problem 2: Learning to implement Neural Network
In this problem, you will develop a neural network solution for classifying Gurmukhi digits.

Dataset

Tasks
Modify the code provided and develop a robust neural network to classify the Gurmukhi digits. Higher performance on the test set will receive a bonus point.
Write your observations about the implementation and submit your code for evaluation.


# Problem 3: Chart Image Classification using CNN
In this problem, you will develop a CNN-based classification architecture for classifying chart images into one of five chart classes: "Line," "Dot Line," "Horizontal Bar," "Vertical Bar," and "Pie" chart.

Dataset
The dataset for this problem can be downloaded from the following link:

Dataset Link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wXdm6RdU0uU1l0Ie7KMQzkHPx40ihdOh/view

Use the train and validation images for training and validation in an appropriate ratio (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for validating). The CSV file contains corresponding labels for the images.

Tasks
Implement a two-layer convolutional neural network and calculate accuracy, loss, and plot the obtained loss.
Write your observations about the implementation and submit your code for evaluation.
Finetune a pre-trained network (e.g., AlexNet) for this task and report the results.
