# Perceptron
Problem 1: Perceptron
Following training samples are given:

x1 x2 Class
1 1 +1
-1 -1 -1
0 0.5 -1
0.1 0.5 -1
0.2 0.2 +1
0.9 0.5 +1
Table 1: Sample data

Assuming weight vector of initial decision boundary wT x = 0 as w=[1, 1], solve the following:
1. In how many steps perception learning algorithm will converge.
2. What will be the final decision boundary? Show step-wise-step update of weight vector
using computation as well as hand-drawn plot.

# CNN
Problem statement: You have to develop a CNN based classification architecture for clas-
sifying a given chart image to one of five chart classes, namely “Line”,“Dot Line”,“Horizontal

Bar”,“Vertical Bar”, and “Pie” chart.
Task 1: Download the dataset from drive link given below.
Dataset link
Use train and val images for training and validation in an appropriate ratio (e.g., 80% for
training and 20 % for validating). The CSV file contains corresponding labels for the images.
Task 2: Implement a two-layer Convolutional Neural Network, and calculate accuracy,
loss and plot the obtained loss. Briefly write your observation and submit your code so that
we can4 evaluate your implementation at our end.
Task 3: Finetune a pretrained network (e.g., AlexNet) for this task and report the results.
